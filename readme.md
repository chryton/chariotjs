# ChariotJS

Chariot is meant to be a dependency neutral alternative to the popular CartJS used in many Shopify stores.

Where CartJS attempts to be a catchall for developing carts, ChariotJS is meant to be a consistent interaction layer with the Shopify REST API on the client-side of the store.

It also allows for rapid, async actions or queued sync actions based on what the user defines rather than all actions being lumped together in a single queue by default.

Chariot also allows for non-cart actions to be taken and unified using the same actions and functionality as the cart.

Plus "chariot" is French for "cart!"
